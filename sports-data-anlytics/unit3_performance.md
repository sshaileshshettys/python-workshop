# Unit 3: Performance Analysis

## Overview

In this unit, we will explore **Performance Analysis** in sports, focusing on how predictive modeling and analytical techniques can be used to evaluate individual players and teams. Understanding performance metrics, and developing models for predicting future performance, are key components of sports analytics.

This unit will also cover **sports rating systems**, which are used to compare players, teams, and performance across different games and seasons. We'll delve into statistical methods that help to make sense of performance data and optimize strategies.

## 1. Understanding Performance Metrics

### a. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Sports

Performance metrics in sports help measure and quantify individual and team performance. These KPIs vary depending on the sport but often include:

- **Goals Scored**
- **Assists**
- **Shots on Target**
- **Pass Completion Rate**
- **Distance Covered**
- **Player Efficiency Rating (PER)**
- **Win Shares**

For example, in **football** (soccer), the key performance indicators for an attacking player might include **goals**, **assists**, **shots**, and **dribbles completed**.

### b. Advanced Metrics

Advanced performance metrics go beyond traditional stats to provide deeper insights. For example:

- **Expected Goals (xG)**: A measure of the quality of a shot based on factors like shot location, type, and previous success rates.
- **Player Impact Estimate (PIE)**: Used in basketball to measure a player's overall impact on a game.
- **Plus-Minus**: A measure of a player’s effect on the game while they are on the court.

These advanced metrics allow teams to gain a better understanding of a player's overall performance.

## 2. Predictive Modeling for Player Performance

### a. Predictive Modeling Overview

Predictive modeling uses historical performance data to forecast future performance. In sports analytics, we use various types of machine learning models (e.g., **linear regression**, **decision trees**, **random forests**, **neural networks**) to make predictions.

#### Example: Predicting Goals Scored

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Assume 'data' is a dataframe containing player stats
X = data[['Shots', 'Assists', 'Pass Completion']]  # Features
y = data['Goals']  # Target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict goals scored
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

### b. Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of your predictive model is critical. Common evaluation metrics for regression models include:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

For classification models (e.g., predicting if a player will score in a match), you might use metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

## 3. Rating Systems in Sports

Rating systems are used to evaluate and rank players and teams based on their performance. These systems assign numerical values to players based on their contribution to the game, allowing for direct comparisons across different players and teams.

### a. Elo Rating System

The **Elo rating system** is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players or teams in two-player games. It is widely used in chess but has been adapted for sports like soccer, tennis, and basketball.

- After each game, the Elo ratings of the players (or teams) are updated based on the game’s outcome. If a higher-rated player wins, their rating increases by a smaller amount than if a lower-rated player wins.

```python
def update_elo(rating_a, rating_b, result, k=32):
    expected_a = 1 / (1 + 10 ** ((rating_b - rating_a) / 400))
    expected_b = 1 - expected_a
    rating_a_new = rating_a + k * (result - expected_a)
    rating_b_new = rating_b + k * ((1 - result) - expected_b)
    return rating_a_new, rating_b_new

# Example usage
rating_team_a = 1500
rating_team_b = 1400
# Team A wins (result=1)
new_rating_a, new_rating_b = update_elo(rating_team_a, rating_team_b, 1)
print(f"Updated ratings - Team A: {new_rating_a}, Team B: {new_rating_b}")
```

### b. Player Rating Systems

In basketball, a popular player rating system is the **Player Efficiency Rating (PER)**, which combines various performance metrics into a single number.

- PER is designed so that the league average is always set to 15. Players above 15 are above average, and players below 15 are below average.

## 4. Factors Affecting Performance

Several factors can influence the performance of athletes. These include:

### a. Physical Fitness
- **Endurance**, **strength**, and **agility** are key indicators of an athlete's physical fitness and can directly impact their performance.

### b. Mental Toughness
- Psychological factors such as **focus**, **motivation**, and **resilience** often separate elite performers from average ones.

### c. External Factors
- Conditions like **weather**, **home vs. away games**, and **crowd support** can influence a player's performance on the field.

### d. Injury History
- Injury history plays a significant role in predicting performance. Players with recurring injuries may perform below their potential or face a higher likelihood of injuries.

## 5. Case Study: Performance Analysis in Soccer

In soccer, performance analysis helps identify individual strengths and weaknesses, team strategies, and opponent tactics. Let's use a case study involving **Expected Goals (xG)** and **Pass Completion Rate**.

### a. Example: Analyzing a Player’s Performance

```python
# Assuming we have data on shots taken and xG values for a player
player_data = pd.read_csv('player_performance.csv')

# Calculate the difference between goals scored and xG
player_data['xG_diff'] = player_data['Goals'] - player_data['xG']

# Plotting the difference
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x=player_data['Shots'], y=player_data['xG_diff'], hue=player_data['Player Name'])
plt.title('xG Difference vs Shots Taken')
plt.xlabel('Shots Taken')
plt.ylabel('xG Difference')
plt.show()
```

In this example, the difference between actual goals and expected goals (xG) provides insight into whether a player is underperforming or overperforming based on their shot quality.

## 6. Advanced Statistical Techniques in Performance Analysis

### a. Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is used to predict a player’s future performance based on historical data. You can use **multiple regression** models that take multiple variables (e.g., shots, passes, minutes played) to predict a single outcome (e.g., goals scored).

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Define independent variables (features) and dependent variable (target)
X = player_data[['Shots', 'Pass Completion', 'Distance Covered']]
y = player_data['Goals']

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict future goals scored
future_goals = model.predict(X)
print(f"Predicted goals: {future_goals}")
```

### b. Clustering for Team Strategy

Clustering techniques such as **K-Means** can be used to group players based on similar performance characteristics. This can help coaches understand which players have complementary skills and should play together.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Use clustering to group players by performance metrics
X = player_data[['Goals', 'Assists', 'Pass Completion']]
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
player_data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X)

# Display players in each cluster
print(player_data.groupby('Cluster').mean())
```
