Hereâ€™s a detailed guide for Unit 2 with code samples for Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, and Numpy:

## Unit 2: Knowing the Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab, Numpy

### 1. Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab

#### Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

**What is Jupyter Notebook?**
- **Definition and Purpose**: Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Key Features and Benefits**: Interactive computing, rich text support, visualization integration, support for many programming languages.

**Installation and Setup**
```bash
# Installing Jupyter Notebook via pip
pip install notebook

# Installing Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda
conda install -c conda-forge notebook

# Starting Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

**Basic Usage and Navigation**
- **Creating a New Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, click on `New` and select `Python 3` to create a new notebook.
- **Navigating the Interface**: The interface includes a menu bar, toolbar, and cells for code and markdown.
- **Writing and Executing Code Cells**: Write code in a cell and press `Shift + Enter` to execute.
- **Using Markdown for Documentation**: Switch cell type to `Markdown` from the drop-down menu and write your documentation.
- **Saving and Exporting Notebooks**: Use `File > Save and Checkpoint` to save. Export via `File > Download as` and choose formats like HTML or PDF.

**Code Sample:**
```python
# Python code cell
print("Hello, Jupyter Notebook!")

# Markdown cell
# This is a Markdown cell
```

#### Introduction to Jupyter Lab

**What is Jupyter Lab?**
- **Definition and Comparison**: Jupyter Lab is an advanced interface for Project Jupyter, providing a more flexible and interactive environment compared to Jupyter Notebook.
- **Key Features and Benefits**: Multiple document interface, integrated development environment, extensibility with plugins.

**Installation and Setup**
```bash
# Installing Jupyter Lab via pip
pip install jupyterlab

# Installing Jupyter Lab via Anaconda
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

# Starting Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

**Basic Usage and Navigation**
- **Overview of the Interface**: Includes a file browser, text editor, terminal, and notebook panels.
- **Creating and Managing Notebooks**: Create notebooks by clicking on `File > New > Notebook`. Manage them in the file browser.
- **Using the Integrated Development Environment Features**: Use the text editor and terminal panels for a complete development experience.

**Code Sample:**
```python
# Python code cell in Jupyter Lab
print("Welcome to Jupyter Lab!")

# Markdown cell in Jupyter Lab
# This is a Markdown cell
```

### 2. Introduction to Numpy

**Basics of Numpy**

**What is Numpy?**
- **Definition and Importance**: Numpy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large number of mathematical functions.
- **Key Features and Benefits**: Efficient array operations, mathematical functions, broadcasting, and advanced indexing.

**Installation and Setup**
```bash
# Installing Numpy via pip
pip install numpy

# Installing Numpy via Anaconda
conda install numpy

# Importing Numpy in Python scripts
import numpy as np
```

**Numpy Arrays and Matrices**

**Creating Numpy Arrays**
```python
import numpy as np

# One-dimensional array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("One-dimensional array:", arr1)

# Multi-dimensional array
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print("Two-dimensional array:\n", arr2)

# Array from lists
list_data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr3 = np.array(list_data)
print("Array from list:", arr3)
```

**Basic Operations with Numpy Arrays**
```python
# Indexing and slicing
print("Element at index 2:", arr1[2])
print("Slice from index 1 to 4:", arr1[1:4])

# Reshaping arrays
arr4 = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Reshaped array:\n", arr4)
```

**Matrix Operations**
```python
# Creating matrices
matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Basic matrix operations
print("Matrix addition:\n", matrix1 + matrix2)
print("Matrix subtraction:\n", matrix1 - matrix2)
print("Matrix multiplication:\n", np.dot(matrix1, matrix2))

# Transpose and inverse
print("Transpose:\n", np.transpose(matrix1))
print("Inverse:\n", np.linalg.inv(matrix1))
```

**Mathematical and Statistical Operations with Numpy**

**Mathematical Functions**
```python
# Common functions
print("Sine of array elements:\n", np.sin(arr1))
print("Exponential of array elements:\n", np.exp(arr1))

# Aggregation functions
print("Sum of array elements:", np.sum(arr1))
print("Mean of array elements:", np.mean(arr1))
print("Median of array elements:", np.median(arr1))
print("Standard deviation of array elements:", np.std(arr1))
```

**Statistical Functions**
```python
# Generating random numbers
rand_array = np.random.rand(5)
print("Random array:", rand_array)

# Statistical summaries
print("Min value:", np.min(arr1))
print("Max value:", np.max(arr1))
print("Percentile (50th):", np.percentile(arr1, 50))
```

**Numpy Classes and Other Features**
```python
# Numpy data types
print("Data type of array elements:", arr1.dtype)

# Broadcasting rules
arr5 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr6 = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
print("Broadcasted addition:\n", arr5 + arr6)

# Advanced indexing
indices = [0, 2]
print("Advanced indexing result:", arr1[indices])
```

### Hands-On Exercises and Examples

**Exercise 1: Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook**
```python
# Create a new notebook and run the following code
print("Hello, Jupyter Notebook!")

# Markdown cell
# This is a Markdown cell where you can document your work.
```

**Exercise 2: Exploring Jupyter Lab**
```python

```

**Exercise 3: Creating and Manipulating Numpy Arrays**
```python
import numpy as np

# Create one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Perform indexing and slicing operations
print("Element at index 2:", arr1[2])
print("Slice from index 1 to 4:", arr1[1:4])

# Reshape array and perform matrix operations
arr3 = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)
print("Reshaped array:\n", arr3)
```

**Exercise 4: Applying Mathematical and Statistical Functions**
```python
import numpy as np

# Use Numpy functions to perform mathematical calculations
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Sine of array elements:\n", np.sin(arr1))

# Generate random numbers and summarize statistical properties
rand_array = np.random.rand(5)
print("Random array:", rand_array)
print("Mean of random array:", np.mean(rand_array))
```
